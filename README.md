## Running
Make sure you have node.js >= 18 and a MongoDB instance. If it's not running on localhost, be sure to modify `RCEM/backendrcm/.env`. Running a MongoDB instance locally is left as an exercise to the reader.

To setup, install dependencies:
- Run `npm -i` inside both the `RCEM/backendrecm` and `RCEM/rcem_nextjs` folders.

To run:
- Run with `npm run dev`.
