# Guest Lecture Response
* **Guest Lecturer:** `Leland Vakarian`
* **Company:** `MITRE`
* **Date:** `11/7`

## Pertinent Questions
* So, what should you learn? As much as you can. Even one tool from each category is enough.
* How to keep from getting overwhelmed? Don't take on or maintain too many projects.

## Lessons Learned
* Projects are not pets, so don't get attached. They are cattle.
* Keep good notes and don't keep secrets, no one likes that guy.
* Don't reinvent the wheel, there is a limit to the number of project someone can maintain in a day.

## Differences in Teaching

* Agile does not mean exactly one thing. Leland's teams only really use Kanban boards, as that is the only part they have found useful.
