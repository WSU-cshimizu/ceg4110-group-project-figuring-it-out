## Agenda

## Notes
We have updated the Milestone 1 date to be back to Oct 4th. Hopefully these are the finalized dates. We still need to write up 
the justification for the changes, TL;DR we figured out what some of the items were and realized some of the dates were too soon.

We worked on the Guest Lecturer Document from todays Dayton Freight Lines presentation. One of the lessons still needs to be pushed 
as of the end of the meeting, but it will be added after fixing a git error.

Finally, we took a look at a wireframe draft and determined that using wireframe.cc was probably better than using MS Paint.

## Action Items
<!-- These are generally distilled from the notes. Essentially, these are "by the next meetings, _this person_ will take _this action_." -->
By 5pm Friday 9/27, the last DFL lession for the guest lecture document will be pushed.

By next meeting, the justification for changing project dates will be written.

By next meeting, we will have drafts of the wireframe created.
