# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* As a team we had effective communication outside of class via Discord text and voice chat.
* We were very understanding and accommodating of each others skillsets. There was help available for those that didn't have the same level of understanding.
* We produced effective wireframes as well as in-class diagrams which were very simple to work off of.

## What could have been better in the group...
* Consistently meeting in our scheduled meeting times could have been better.
* We should have taken more advantage of asking questions and making sure we knew exactly what needed to be done.
* We should have set more realistic dates from the start, rather than needing to change them multiple times.

## What went well in the class...
* The guest lectures were very informative and helpful. They provided several different perspectives on software development.
* In class work such as creating the different diagrams and drawing out some of the project functionality helped us better comprehend how the project should work.
* There was always room to ask questions, which made it easier to clarify things.

## What could have been better in the class...
* Checking in with individual groups more often could have been better, milestone check-ins.
* Certain deliverables could have been explained better. As we went through the semester we would find out that something was not 
how we originally thought and we needed to update documents and timelines to fix it.
* More structured feedback on our work would have helped us improve on future work.
